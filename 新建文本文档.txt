well i've think a lot these days about our future.i would like to say the R2 thing is really part of my heart illness,cause i kept worrying about this and now it still has chance to happen.firstly let's talk about the situation when you don't pass the exam.so you said if youre not going to pass R2 exam this time and will go to class for a yr,from when to when will you have the class?when will you have your next exam?(i think next time you should have R1 exam too cause it's nessesary)after you have you next exam,will you gonna make it in time to apply the german univerity?(i mean the Jan.15th time for the german course,but you need to be accepted to the major too).cause if you do that,you'll study the first semester when i start my 5th semester(2 yrs younger than me).i just have to say at first i really can't accept it,cause it's too long and if we keep going then the situation will become two:i'll have higher education than you(i'll definately go to study master course),or i got a job and you still study master.neither way are good.and my parents won't agree with that(I'm so sorry,my parents are very traditional persons...some aspect i think just like him).so that's why i can't accept it.but i really like you,like really,love you,and your family.so i really think a long time,and i think this can work if you did things below(if you still wanna be with me and in the future):study harder math and pass R1,R2 exam,apply successfully KIT or other good university with good CS major,pass DSH and become a student officially,use 3 yrs(6 semester) study REALLY HARD your major(besides course you can do some internship or go to join some big programming competition,anyway make your resume awesome).you'll graduate at 25 yrs old,I'll try to study one more yr in master so i can gratuate at 26 yrs old,so you will get into a GOOD company one yr eailer than me,then that'll do it(at this point education will not be a disadvantage if you have really good resume and find a really good job).then my parents will maybe agree with us.that's the best situation.but almost all your time in bachelor will spend on study and coding and learning,trust me it's not easy,and german university is already very very hard.yes i am too strict to you,it sounds like im planing your life(yes i am and im really sorry),but this thoughts exist on my mind for days and i have to tell you and communicate with you about that.if you think it's really hard for yourself to do that or you don't think you'll like it,that's fine,you can study R1 and pass it and become a student in norwegian univerity ,it'll be easier for you,it just that we will have to seprate,it's a pity.
you know i always have highly demand for myself,cause im always trying to be better,i have already choose what i love(computer science),and i try very hard get into the university i love,i have to fight to live cause bachelor course is not that easy.i just wanna someone i love could strive life with me and comfort me when i got lost or become very sad(i'll do that to you too if you feel this way).i wanna graduate in time and fina a good job so i can have a good life,become the person i wanna be.love isn't all i need but i wish i could have it in a appropriate time.i wish you're the right one,that's why i typed so much to you.you'll probably feel very annoying,apologize again.if you don't wanna do that,that's totally fine,just tell me :)
